# Vertical proof map

Date: 2026-08-10

No arrow is accepted unless it has its own proved implication and model card.
Every `SAT` occurrence means the exact total `SAT-gamma` language in
`docs/sat-encoding.md`.

```text
P != NP
  <- T-UNIFORM: SAT notin P
  <- T-NONUNIFORM: SAT notin P/poly
     == V-1: NP notsubseteq P/poly
  <- all same-language rungs: for every k, SAT notin SIZE(n^k)
  <- GATE-005 (downstream, open): same-language exponent amplification
  <- GATE-004 (active): first superlinear unrestricted SAT circuit lower bound
  <- GATE-004B (active smallest brick): SAT-specific amortized block restriction
     + LEMMA-002 (proved recurrence)
```

`T-UNIFORM <- T-NONUNIFORM` is valid because every uniform polynomial-time
decider unrolls to polynomial-size Boolean circuits. `T-NONUNIFORM` and `V-1`
are equivalent through Cook-Levin reductions, provided the reduction's circuit
size blow-up is recorded.

## V-1 model card

Statement: there exists one language `L in NP` such that for every constant
`d`, every Boolean circuit family of size `O(n^d)` fails to decide `L` on at
least one input length (indeed infinitely many lengths).

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Computational model | NP verifier on multitape Turing machine; Boolean circuits over `{AND,OR,NOT}` |
| Uniform/non-uniform | Uniform verifier versus non-uniform circuit adversary |
| Circuit size | All polynomial sizes `O(n^d)`, every fixed `d` |
| Circuit depth | Unrestricted |
| Fan-in | AND/OR two; NOT one |
| Randomness | None |
| Advice | Polynomial advice is absorbed into the circuit family |
| Oracle access | None |
| Field/algebraic model | None |
| Asymptotic quantifiers | `exists L in NP, forall d, forall circuit families, infinitely many failure lengths` |
| Regime | Worst-case exact total-language decision |

## Rejected decomposition: GATE-003

GATE-003 asked for a uniformly indexed sequence `(L_j)` satisfying GATE-002
with unbounded exponent ratio. It is now `NO-GO` as an intermediate brick:
GATE-002 proves that it implies `NP notsubseteq P/poly`, while repeating one
language in `NP \ P/poly` with `b(j)=j` proves the converse. The proposed brick
is therefore equivalent to V-1 and not smaller than the terminal-sufficient
theorem.

LEMMA-001 also proves that reindexing and polynomial padding preserve or reduce
the exponent ratio, so those operations cannot repair the Murray-Williams
profile.

## Active lower-bound target: GATE-004

Prove that for one explicit constant `delta>0`, the fixed SAT language requires
more than `n^{1+delta}` gates in unrestricted non-uniform fan-in-two Boolean
circuits for infinitely many lengths. This would be a genuine same-language
general-circuit lower bound, but it would not itself exclude larger polynomial
circuit families.

## GATE-004 model card

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Computational model | General acyclic Boolean circuits computing exact `SAT-gamma` language slices |
| Uniform/non-uniform | Fully non-uniform circuit adversary |
| Circuit size | Exclude `O(n^{1+delta})` for one fixed explicit `delta>0` |
| Circuit depth | Unrestricted |
| Fan-in | AND/OR two; NOT one |
| Randomness | None |
| Advice | Polynomial advice is represented by the arbitrary circuit family |
| Oracle access | None |
| Field/algebraic model | None |
| Asymptotic quantifiers | Exists fixed `delta>0`; infinitely many lengths; every circuit within the size bound fails on some input |
| Regime | Worst-case exact total-language decision; malformed encodings reject |

## Smallest active brick: GATE-004B

For every minimum circuit computing `SAT-gamma_n`, find a coordinate projection
to `SAT-gamma_m`, losing at most `A n^beta` input length but forcing at least
`B n^(beta+delta)` gates to disappear. LEMMA-002 proves that iterating this
recurrence yields the GATE-004 lower bound. ENC-002 supplies exact
double-negation projections; generic fanout counting does not supply the needed
gate loss.

## Downstream amplification obligation: GATE-005

To turn GATE-004 into a terminal chain, a separate same-language amplification
theorem must advance a proved SAT lower-bound exponent by a fixed positive
amount without changing the circuit model. Iterating that theorem would have to
cover every polynomial exponent. No such theorem is claimed.

## Excluded pseudo-routes

- `NEXP notsubseteq C` for a restricted class `C` has no recorded implication
  to `P != NP`.
- `for every k, there exists L_k in NP` needing more than `n^k` circuits does
  not swap to `there exists L in NP, for every k`.
- GATE-003's unbounded-ratio family is equivalent to the desired non-uniform
  separation and receives no credit as a decomposition.
- A uniform circuit-generation lower bound does not automatically give a
  non-uniform circuit lower bound.
- Average-case, promise, randomized, oracle, algebraic, proof-system, and
  communication results require separate terminal bridges.
