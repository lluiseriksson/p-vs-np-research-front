# Verification ledger

Passing repository checks certifies metadata consistency, not mathematical
truth. Each row has exactly one label.

| ID | Label | Result | Evidence | Terminal effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| INFRA-001 | PROVED | Required repository tree, policies, manifest, and cold-clone reproduction exist | `verification/audit.py`; `artifacts/cold-clone-a9865ce.md` | None |
| T-UNIFORM | PROVED | `SAT notin P` is equivalent to `P != NP` under Cook-Levin | Cook problem statement/source note | Defines target only |
| T-NONUNIFORM | PROVED | `SAT notin P/poly` implies `P != NP` | Circuit unrolling plus T-UNIFORM | Terminal-sufficient, not established |
| BARRIER-001 | PROVED | Major barrier/failure-mode audit | `docs/barrier-audit.md` and primary-source notes | Design constraints only |
| BRIDGE-001 | PROVED | SAT/Circuit-SAT bridge audit | `docs/bridge-audit.md` | Finds no closed terminal bridge |
| GATE-001 | NO-GO | Existing Williams-style transfer cannot be promoted directly to SAT outside P/poly | Quantifier and parameter audit | Prevents a circular promotion |
| GATE-002 | PROVED | Unbounded exponent ratio suffices to uniformize a hard-language family into one NP language outside P/poly | Human proof in `proofs/GATE-002-exponent-ratio-uniformization.md` | Conditional route; hypothesis unfilled |
| GATE-003 | EXPLORATORY | Construct a family satisfying GATE-002 for general circuits | Open statement and initial parameter substitution | Active smallest brick |
| FORMAL-001 | EXPLORATORY | Formalize stable encoding and padding lemmas | `formal/README.md` | 0% formally closed chain |

There are no `FORMALLY VERIFIED` or `NUMERICAL` results at this commit.
